### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Seyi from Nigeria but presently in Newcastle upon Tyne UK, and I do programming and software development. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React, Django, Express, as well as work in Databases including SQL and NoSQL. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general.
