#### Software Developer

I'm Seyi from Nigeria but presently in Newcastle upon Tyne UK, and I do programming and software development. 
I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Django, Express, React, as well as work in Databases including SQL and NoSQL. 
I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general.
